# time2code.today

<time2code.today> is a website for learning to code in Python (or C#). I stumbled across it and thought that it would be fun to work through the tasks and see if anything actually challenges me. The first few levels are just learning syntax, but beyond that it is actually stuff that (might) be a challenge, as they involve algorithms and the like, which i don't really find myself implementing very often, as Python features such extensive builtins - oftentimes written in C, meaning it is impossible for my shoddy Python code to run faster.

I completing 5 tasks per level: the first 3, main, tasks for the level, and then the last 2 challenge tasks.

## Completion

- Level 1
- Level 2
- Level 3
- Level 4

Note: I started using type annotations only from level 2 onwards, and they can be very helpful, so I will probably start to integrate these into my other (real) projects from now on - very nice.
